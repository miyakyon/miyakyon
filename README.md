I am in trouble with terrible response delay with Vysor Pro version since a week ago. Previously, there was no such case. This takes place with a specific Android app. So, I firstly doubt that the app was an issue. Now I came to the conclusion that the app is no issue because I tested with another android phone with the same app besides the app has worked perfectly with Vysor in the past. The name of app is vFlat which is one of scanning apps. It works on the phone. On the other hand, there is awful delay occurring on Vysor mirroring. Is anybody who experienced the same issue? Please suggest me how to resolve it. No help with newly installing different version of Vysor as well as ADB drivers. I would have almost given up that I would use this app with Vysor. Thanks.
